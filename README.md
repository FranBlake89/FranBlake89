## 👋 Hey there, I'm Francisco Castillo
### 🌱 From Seeds to Code: Cultivating Technology and Growth 🌱

Hello! I'm Francisco Castillo, a passionate computer programming student who finds joy in embracing new technologies and crafting web applications. With a background in agricultural engineering 🌱 and hands-on experience as an assistant researcher in evolutionary ecology 🐛 in Chile, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving to the world of programming.

## 🌐 What I've Been Up To

- 💻 I have built a library web application and a web API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. I have also developed an assembly line simulation with C++.
- 📚 I have completed courses on Next.js and Python for Data Science, and I’m always curious to learn more.
- 🌎 My goal is to code for open source projects and solve problems from the real world.
- 🔭 I’m seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my programming skills and learn from experienced developers.
